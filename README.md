# Amazon Retro-Style Portfolio

Welcome to the Amazon Retro-Style Portfolio project! This is a personal portfolio that showcases my skills, projects, and experiences in a fun, retro-inspired design. The portfolio mimics the look and feel of websites from the 90s amazon website, offering a nostalgic yet modern take on a personal webpage.
